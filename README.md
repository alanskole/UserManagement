# ManageUsers
A .net core 3.1 class library for managing users and authentication. 

You only need to extend the abstract class UserManagement and pass a connection string to an sqlite database and an email address and password for the email to send account activation code and forgotten passwords to the registered users to the constructor of the class that extends the UserManagement class.
